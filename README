NAME
    Math::BigInt::Pari - a math backend library based on Math::Pari

SYNOPSIS
        # to use it with Math::BigInt
        use Math::BigInt lib => 'Pari';

        # to use it with Math::BigFloat
        use Math::BigFloat lib => 'Pari';

        # to use it with Math::BigRat
        use Math::BigRat lib => 'Pari';

DESCRIPTION
    Math::BigInt::Pari inherits from Math::BigInt::Lib.

    Provides support for big integer in Math::BigInt et al. calculations via
    means of Math::Pari, an XS layer on top of the very fast PARI library.
